# Notes on RedRobotics Redboard+

This is for driving a robot using the [RedRobotics Redboard+](https://github.com/RedRobotics/RedBoard). This board deals with nearly everything a Raspberry Pi robot will need.

Like the other motor modules in this project, it will follow the GPIOZero robot interface.  

## Setup

The repo describes setup as `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedRobotics/RedBoard/master/system/setup.sh | bash`.
