# Bus archtiecture

This project will be based on some connected MQTT components, using a mosquitto instance as the the broker.

## Installing

`fab setup_mqtt` -> Will become part of main setup when established

## Libraries

We want this to be asynchronous capable. We will use the asyncio-mqtt library <https://pypi.org/project/asyncio-mqtt/> along with [paho](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python).


## Messages and message types

### Motors

- Topic: `motors/left` and `motors/right`
  payloads: -1.0 to 1.0

- Topic: `motors/values`
  payload: left (-1 to 1.0), right (-1 to 1.0)

- Topic: `motors/forward`
  payload (optional): speed (0 to 1.0)- defaults to 1.0, optional curve (-1 to 1.0) - defaults to 0.0
- Topic: `motors/backward`
  payload (optional): speed (0 to 1.0)- defaults to 1.0, optional curve (-1 to 1.0) - defaults to 0.0
- Topic: `motors/stop`
- Maybe topic `motors/reverse`. Not 100% sure.

Assume 1 second duration, or until next command.

## Project folder structure

Currently, a bit messy. Let's rejig - with service oriented setup.

Forget "src" which is generic, and have "robot".
