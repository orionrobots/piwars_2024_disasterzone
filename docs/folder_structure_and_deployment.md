# Folder structure and deployment

## Deployment

We need to deploy a few things:

- Basic setup
- Particular projects behaviours should all be deployed out.
- Board specific setup
    - Deploy any dependancies
    - Select the service that we'd run for it.

Ideally, this would be idempotent. That is - it can be run multiple times without issues, like constantly rebooting the Pi or services unnecessarily.

## Project folder structure

Currently, a bit messy. Let's rejig - with service oriented setup.

Forget "src" which is generic, and have "robot".
